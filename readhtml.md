What Information Your Visitors Need
You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve 
their goals quickly and effectively



How Often People Will Visit Your Site

Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other 
content remains relatively static.

Site Maps
Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages

WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require

Getting your message across using design
The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
